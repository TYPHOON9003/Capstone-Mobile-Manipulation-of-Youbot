This projects Covers following topics :

Generate the kinematics simulator of the youBot - an omnidirectional mobile robot with a 5-DOF robotic arm.

Plan the end-effector's trajectory between waypoints.

Apply feedback control to drive the robot in the desired trajectory.

Simulate the planned trajectory in CoppeliaSim.


# Instructions
change the assigned values of variable in function main in file file main.py (unless you know what you are doing xD!)
